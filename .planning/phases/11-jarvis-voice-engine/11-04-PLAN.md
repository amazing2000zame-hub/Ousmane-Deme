# 11-04: Voice Settings Panel + Personality Tuning

## Goal
Voice settings UI panel, voice toggle button in chat header, system prompt adjustments for spoken output, and TTS cost tracking.

## Files to Create
- `jarvis-ui/src/components/center/VoiceSettings.tsx` — Settings panel (voice, speed, volume, auto-play, mic, wake word)

## Files to Modify
- `jarvis-ui/src/components/center/CenterDisplay.tsx` — Add voice toggle button to chat header
- `jarvis-backend/src/ai/system-prompt.ts` — Voice-aware prompt adjustments (shorter responses for spoken output)
- `jarvis-backend/src/realtime/chat.ts` — Track TTS cost alongside LLM cost in chat:done event

## Design
- Settings panel slides out from voice toggle button
- Voice toggle is a prominent button in the chat header bar
- When voice mode is active, system prompt instructs JARVIS to keep responses concise and natural for speech
- TTS cost tracked via X-TTS-Cost header from /api/tts response
